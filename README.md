Collage is a screensaver for macOS that lets you add feeds and display them in an animated collage.

## Current caveats:
Feed processing is done at the moment with some rigid regex to strip out the images. This means it doesn't work if your feed has escaped characters. It's been tested with Tumblr and APOD.

Multiple feed support is coming later.
